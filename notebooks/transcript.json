{"0":{"0":"Good evening from the Health Education Campus of Case Western Reserve University and the Cleveland Clinic. I\u2019m Chris Wallace of Fox News and I welcome you to the first of the 2020 Presidential Debates between President Donald J. Trump and former Vice President Joe Biden. This debate is sponsored by the Commission on Presidential debates. The Commission has designed the format, six roughly 15 minute segments with two minute answers from each candidate to the first question, then open discussion for the rest of each segment. Both campaigns have agreed to these rules. For the record, I decided the topics and the questions in each topic. I can assure you none of the questions has been shared with the Commission or the two candidates.","1":"This debate is being conducted under health and safety protocols designed by the Cleveland Clinic, which is serving as the Health Security advisor to the Commission for all four debates. As a precaution, both campaigns have agreed the candidates will not shake hands at the beginning of tonight\u2019s debate. The audience here in the hall has promised to remain silent. No cheers, no boos, or other interruptions so we, and more importantly you, can focus on what the candidates have to say. No noise except right now, as we welcome the Republican nominee, President Trump, and the Democratic nominee Vice President Biden.","2":"How you doing, man?","3":" How are you doing?","4":"I\u2019m well.","5":" Gentlemen, a lot of people been waiting for this night, so let\u2019s get going. Our first subject is the Supreme Court. President Trump, you nominated Amy Coney Barrett over the weekend to succeed the late Ruth Bader Ginsburg on the Court. You say the Constitution is clear about your obligation and the Senate\u2019s to consider a nominee to the Court. Vice President Biden, you say that this is an effort by the President and Republicans to jam through on an appointment in what you call an abuse of power. My first question to both of you tonight, why are you right in the argument you make and your opponent wrong? And where do you think a Justice Barrett would take the court? President Trump, in this first segment, you go first. Two minutes.","6":" Thank you very much, Chris. I will tell you very simply. We won the election. Elections have consequences. We have the Senate, we have the White House, and we have a phenomenal nominee respected by all. Top, top academic, good in every way. Good in every way. In fact, some of her biggest endorsers are very liberal people from Notre Dame and other places. So I think she\u2019s going to be fantastic. We have plenty of time. Even if we did it after the election itself. I have a lot of time after the election, as you know. So I think that she will be outstanding. She\u2019s going to be as good as anybody that has served on that court. We really feel that. We have a professor at Notre Dame, highly respected by all, said she\u2019s the single greatest student he\u2019s ever had. He\u2019s been a professor for a long time at a great school.","7":" And we won the election and therefore we have the right to choose her, and very few people knowingly would say otherwise. And by the way, the Democrats, they wouldn\u2019t even think about not doing it. The only difference is they\u2019d try and do it faster. There\u2019s no way they would give it up. They had Merrick Garland, but the problem is they didn\u2019t have the election so they were stopped. And probably that would happen in reverse, also. Definitely would happen in reverse. So we won the election and we have the right to do it, Chris.","8":" President Trump, thank you. Same question to you, Vice President Biden. You have two minutes.","9":"Well, first of all, thank you for doing this and looking forward to this, Mr. President.","10":" Thank you, Joe.","11":"The American people have a right to have a say in who the Supreme Court nominee is and that say occurs when they vote for United States Senators and when they vote for the President of United States. They\u2019re not going to get that chance now because we\u2019re in the middle of an election already. The election has already started. Tens of thousands of people already voted and so the thing that should happen is we should wait. We should wait and see what the outcome of this election is because that\u2019s the only way the American people get to express their view is by who they elect as President and who they elect as Vice President.","12":"Now, what\u2019s at stake here is the President\u2019s made it clear, he wants to get rid of the Affordable Care Act. He\u2019s been running on that, he ran on that and he\u2019s been governing on that. He\u2019s in the Supreme Court right now trying to get rid of the Affordable Care Act, which will strip 20 million people from having health insurance now, if it goes into court. And the justice, I\u2019m not opposed to the justice, she seems like a very fine person. But she\u2019s written, before she went in the bench, which is her right, that she thinks that the Affordable Care Act is not Constitutional. The other thing that\u2019s on the court, and if it\u2019s struck down, what happens? Women\u2019s rights are fundamentally changed. Once again, a woman could pay more money because she has a pre-existing condition of pregnancy. They\u2019re able to charge women more for the same exact procedure a man gets.","13":"And that ended when we, in fact, passed the Affordable Care Act, and there\u2019s a hundred million people who have pre-existing conditions and they\u2019ll be taken away as well. Those pre-existing conditions, insurance companies are going to love this. And so it\u2019s just not appropriate to do this before this election. If he wins the election and the Senate is Republican, then he goes forward. If not, we should wait until February.","14":" There aren\u2019t a hundred million people with pre-existing conditions. As far as a say is concerned, the people already had their say. Okay, Justice Ginsburg said very powerfully, very strongly, at some point 10 years ago or so, she said a President and the Senate is elected for a period of time, but a President is elected for four years. We\u2019re not elected for three years. I\u2019m not elected for three years. So we have the Senate, we have a President-","15":"He\u2019s elected to the next election.","16":" During that period of time, during that period of time, we have an opening. I\u2019m not elected for three years. I\u2019m elected for four years. Joe, the hundred million people is totally wrong. I don\u2019t know where you got that number. The bigger problem that you have is that you\u2019re going to extinguish 180 million people with their private health care, that they\u2019re very happy this.","17":"That\u2019s simply not true.","18":" Well, you\u2019re certainly going to socialist. You\u2019re going to socialist medicine-","19":" Gentlemen, we\u2019re now into open discussion.","20":"Open discussion.","21":" Open discussion, yes, I agree. Go ahead, Vice President.","22":"Number one, he knows what I proposed. What I proposed is that we expand Obamacare and we increase it. We do not wipe any. And one of the big debates we had with 23 of my colleagues trying to win the nomination that I won, were saying that Biden wanted to allow people to have private insurance still. They can. They do. They will under my proposal.","23":" That\u2019s not what you\u2019ve said and it\u2019s not what your party is saying.","24":"That is simply a lie.","25":" Your party doesn\u2019t say it. Your party wants to go socialist medicine and socialist healthcare.","26":"The party is me. Right now, I am the Democratic Party.","27":" And they\u2019re going to dominate you, Joe. You know that.","28":"I am the Democratic Party right now.","29":" Not according to Harris.","30":"The platform of the Democratic Party is what I, in fact, approved of, what I approved of. Now, here\u2019s the deal. The deal is that it\u2019s going to wipe out pre-existing conditions. And, by the way, the 20, the 200 mil- the 200,000 people that have died on his watch, how many of those have survived? Well, there\u2019s seven million people that contracted COVID. What does it mean for them going forward if you strike down the Affordable Care Act?","31":" Joe, you\u2019ve had 308,000 military people dying because you couldn\u2019t provide them proper healthcare in the military. So don\u2019t tell me about this.","32":"I\u2019m happy to talk about this.","33":" And if you were here, it wouldn\u2019t be 200, it would be two million people because you were very late on the draw. You didn\u2019t want me to ban China, which was heavily infected. You didn\u2019t want me to ban Europe.","34":" All right, gentlemen, Mr. President.","35":" You would have been much later, Joe, much later.","36":" Mr. President.","37":" We\u2019re talking about two million people.","38":"You\u2019re not going to be able to shut him up.","39":" Mr. President, as the moderator, we are going to talk about COVID in the next segment. But go ahead.","40":"Let me finish. The point is that the President also is opposed to Roe V. Wade. That\u2019s on the ballot as well and the court, in the court, and so that\u2019s also at stake right now. And so the election is all-","41":" You don\u2019t know what\u2019s on the ballot. Why is it on the ballot? Why is it on the ballot? It\u2019s not on the ballot.","42":"It\u2019s on the ballot in the court.","43":" I don\u2019t think so.","44":"In the court.","45":" There\u2019s nothing happening there.","46":"Donald would you just be quiet for a minute.","47":" You don\u2019t know her view on Roe V. Wade? You don\u2019t know here view.","48":" Well, all right. All right. Let\u2019s talk. We\u2019ve got a lot to unpack here, gentlemen. We\u2019ve got a lot of time. On healthcare, and then we\u2019ll come back to Roe V. Wade.","49":"All right.","50":" Mr. President, the Supreme Court will hear a case a week after the election in which the Trump Administration, along with 18 state Attorney Generals are seeking to overturn Obamacare, to end Obamacare.","51":" That\u2019s right.","52":" You have spent the last week-","53":" Because they want to give good healthcare.","54":" If I may ask my question, sir.","55":"Good healthcare.","56":" Over the last four years, you have promised to repeal and replace Obamacare, but you have never in these four years come up with a plan, a comprehensive plan, to replace Obamacare.","57":" Yes, I have. Of course, I have. The individual mandate.","58":" [crosstalk 001126] when I finish I\u2019m going to give an opportunity-","59":" Excuse me. I got rid of the individual mandate, which was a big chunk of Obamacare.","60":" That\u2019s not a comprehensive place.","61":" That is absolutely a big thing. That was the worst part of Obamacare.","62":" I didn\u2019t ask, sir.","63":" Chris, that was the worst part of Obamacare.","64":" You\u2019re debating him not me. Let me ask my question.","65":" Well, I\u2019ll ask Joe. The individual mandate was the most unpopular aspect of Obamacare.","66":" Mr. President.","67":" I got rid of it. And we will protect people.","68":" Mr. President, I\u2019m the moderator of this debate and I would like you to let me ask my question and then you can answer.","69":" Go ahead.","70":" You, in the course of these four years, have never come up with a comprehensive plan to replace Obamacare, and just this last Thursday you signed a largely symbolic Executive Order to protect people with pre-existing conditions five days before this debate. So my question, sir, is what is the Trump healthcare plan?","71":" Well, first of all, I guess I\u2019m debating you, not him, but that\u2019s okay. I\u2019m not surprised. Let me just tell you something. There\u2019s nothing symbolic. I\u2019m cutting drug prices. I\u2019m going with Favored Nations, which no President has the courage to do because you\u2019re going against big pharma. Drug prices will be coming down 80 or 90%. You could have done it during your 47 year period in government, but you didn\u2019t do it. Nobody\u2019s done it. So we\u2019re cutting healthcare.","72":" What about pre-existing conditions?","73":" All of the things that we\u2019ve done.","74":"He has not done healthcare.","75":" I\u2019ll give you an example. Insulin, it was destroying families, destroying people, the cost. I\u2019m getting it for so cheap it\u2019s like water, you want to know the truth. So cheap. Take a look at all of the drugs that what we\u2019re doing. Prescription drug prices, we\u2019re going to allow our Governors now to go to other countries to buy drugs because when they paid just a tiny fraction of what we do.","76":" Okay, like I say, this is open discussion.","77":" This is big stuff.","78":" Sir, you\u2019ll be happy. I\u2019m about to pick up on one of your points to ask the Vice President, which is, he points out that you would like to add a public option to Obamacare.","79":"Yes.","80":" And the argument that he makes and other Republicans make is that that is going to end private insurance.","81":"It is not.","82":" If I start asking the question.","83":" That\u2019s not what your party says, by the way.","84":" And it will end private insurance and create a government takeover of health.","85":"It does not. It\u2019s only for those people who are so poor they qualify for Medicaid they can get that free in most States, except Governors who want to deny people who are poor Medicaid. Anyone who qualifies for Medicare, excuse me, Medicaid would automatically be enrolled in the public option. The vast majority of the American people would still not be in that option. Number one. Number two.","86":" Joe, you agreed with Bernie Sanders, who\u2019s far left, on the manifesto, we call it. And that gives you socialized medicine.","87":"Look, hey.","88":" Are you saying you didn\u2019t agree?","89":"I\u2019m not going to listen to him. The fact of the matter is I beat Bernie Sanders.","90":" Not by much.","91":"I beat him by a whole hell of a lot.","92":" Not by much.","93":"I\u2019m here standing facing you, old buddy.","94":" If Pocahontas would have left two days early you would have lost every primary.","95":"All he knows how to do-","96":" On Super Tuesday, you got very lucky.","97":"Look he\u2019s the deal. I got very lucky. I\u2019m going to get very lucky tonight as well.","98":" With what?","99":"And tonight I\u2019m going to make sure.","100":" With what?","101":"Because here\u2019s the deal, here\u2019s the deal. The fact is that everything he\u2019s saying so far is simply a lie. I\u2019m not here to call out his lies. Everybody knows he\u2019s a liar.","102":" But you agree. Joe, you\u2019re the liar. You graduated last in your class not first in your class.","103":"God, I want to make sure-","104":" Mr. President, can you let him finish, sir?","105":"No, he doesn\u2019t know how to do that.","106":" You\u2019d be surprised. You\u2019d be surprised. Go ahead, Joe.","107":"The wrong guy, the wrong night, at the wrong time.","108":" Listen, you agreed with Bernie Sanders and the manifesto.","109":"There is no manifesto, number one.","110":" Please let him speak, Mr. President.","111":"Number two.","112":" He just lost the left.","113":"Number two.","114":" You just lost the left. You agreed with Bernie Sanders on a plan that you absolutely agreed to and under that plan [crosstalk 001510], they call it socialized medicine.","115":" Mr. President.","116":"I\u2019ll tell you what, he is not for any help for people needing healthcare.","117":" Who is, Bernie?","118":"Because he, in fact, already has costs 10 million people their healthcare that they had from their employers because of his recession. Number one. Number two, there are 20 million people getting healthcare through Obamacare now that he wants to take it away. He won\u2019t ever look you in the eye and say that\u2019s what he wants to do. Take it away.","119":" No, I want to give them better healthcare at a much lower price, because Obamacare is no good.","120":"He doesn\u2019t know how. He doesn\u2019t know how to do that.","121":" I\u2019ve already fixed it.","122":"He has never offered a plan.","123":" We\u2019ve already fixed it to an extent. Obamacare, as you might know but probably don\u2019t, Obamacare is no good.","124":" Gentlemen, you realize if you\u2019re both speaking at the same time. Let the President. Go ahead, sir.","125":" Obamacare is no good. We made it better and I had a choice to make very early on. We took away the individual mandate. We guaranteed pre-existing conditions, but took away the individual mandate. Listen, this is the way it is. And that destroyed \u2026 They shouldn\u2019t even call it Obamacare, then I had a choice to make, do I let my people run it really well or badly? If I run it badly, they\u2019ll probably blame him, but they\u2019ll blame me. But more importantly, I want to help people. Okay. I said, \u201cYou\u2019ve got to run it so well.\u201d And I just had a meeting with them. They said the problem is, no matter how well you run Obamacare, it\u2019s a disaster. It\u2019s too expensive. Premiums are too high, that it doesn\u2019t work. So we do want to get rid of it. Chris, we want to get rid of that and give something that\u2019s cheaper and better.","126":" I understand that, sir. But I have to give you roughly equal time.","127":" Go ahead.","128":" Please let the Vice President talk, sir.","129":" Good.","130":"He has no plan for healthcare.","131":" Of course, we do.","132":" Please.","133":"He sends out wishful thinking. He has Executive Orders that have no power. He hasn\u2019t lowered drug costs for anybody. He\u2019s been promising a healthcare plan since he got elected. He has none, like almost everything else he talks about. He does not have a plan. He doesn\u2019t have a plan. And the fact is this man doesn\u2019t know what he\u2019s talking about. [crosstalk 001714].","134":" All right, I have one final question for you.","135":"Sure.","136":" Mr. Vice President, if Senate Republicans, we were talking originally about the Supreme Court here, if Senate Republicans go ahead and confirm Justice Barrett there has been talk about ending the filibuster or even packing the court, adding to the nine justices there. You call this a distraction by the President. But, in fact, it wasn\u2019t brought up by the President. It was brought up by some of your Democratic colleagues in the Congress. So my question to you is, you have refused in the past to talk about it, are you willing to tell the American tonight whether or not you will support either ending the filibuster or packing the court?","137":"Whatever position I take on that, that\u2019ll become the issue. The issue is the American people should speak. You should go out and vote. You\u2019re voting now. Vote and let your Senators know strongly how you feel.","138":" Are you going to pack the court?","139":"Vote now.","140":" Are you going to pack the court?","141":"Make sure you, in fact, let people know, your Senators.","142":" He doesn\u2019t want to answer the question.","143":"I\u2019m not going to answer the question.","144":" Why wouldn\u2019t you answer that question? You want to put a lot of new Supreme Court Justices. Radical left.","145":"Will you shut up, man?","146":" Listen, who is on your list, Joe? Who\u2019s on your list?","147":" Gentlemen, I think we\u2019ve ended this-","148":"This is so un-Presidential.","149":" He\u2019s going to pack the court. He is not going to give a list.","150":" We have ended the segment. We\u2019re going to move on to the second segment.","151":"That was really a productive segment, wasn\u2019t it? Keep yapping, man.","152":" The people understand, Joe.","153":"They sure do.","154":" 47 years, you\u2019ve done nothing. They\u2019re understand.","155":" All right, the second subject is COVID-19, which is an awfully serious subject. So let\u2019s try to be serious about it. We have had more than seven million cases of coronavirus in the United States and more than 200,000 people have died. Even after we produce a vaccine, experts say that it could be months or even years before we come back to anything approaching normal. My question for both of you is, based on what you have said and done so far, and what you have said you would do starting in 2021, why should the American people trust you more than your opponent to deal with this public health crisis going forward? In this case, the question goes to you first, sir. Two minutes, uninterrupted.","156":"Good luck. 200,000 dead. As you said, over seven million infected in the United States. We, in fact, have 4% of the world\u2019s population, 20% of the deaths. 40,000 people a day are contracting COVID. In addition to that, about between 750 and 1000 people a day are dying. When he was presented with that number, he said, \u201cIt is what it is.\u201d Well, it is what it is because you are who you are. That\u2019s why it is. The President has no plan. He hasn\u2019t laid out anything. He knew all the way back in February how serious this crisis was. He knew it was a deadly disease. What did he do? He\u2019s on tape as acknowledging he knew it. He said he didn\u2019t tell us or give people a warning of it because he didn\u2019t want to panic the American people. You don\u2019t panic. He panicked. In addition to that, what did he do?","157":"He went in and we were insisting that the people we had in the ground in China should be able to go to Wuhan and determine for themselves how dangerous this was. He did not even ask Xi to do that.","158":" Wrong.","159":"He told us what a great job Xi was doing. He said we owe him debt of gratitude for being so transparent with us. And what did he do then? He then did nothing. He waited and waited and waited. He still doesn\u2019t have a plan.","160":" Wrong.","161":" Sir, it\u2019s his two minutes.","162":" It\u2019s so wrong.","163":"I laid out back in March, exactly what we should be doing. And I laid out again in July, what we should be doing. We should be providing all the protective gear possible. We should be providing the money the House has passed in order to be able to go out and get people the help they need to keep their businesses open. Open schools cost a lot of money. You should get out of your bunker and get out of the sand trap in your golf course and go in the Oval Office and bring together the Democrats and Republicans and fund what needs to be done now to save lives.","164":" So, if we would have listened to you.","165":" Wait, wait. You have two minutes, sir.","166":" If we would\u2019ve listened to you, the country would have been left wide open, millions of people would have died, not 200,000. And one person is too much. It\u2019s China\u2019s fault. It should have never happened. They stopped it from going in, but it was China\u2019s fault. And, by the way, when you talk about numbers, you don\u2019t know how many people died in China. You don\u2019t know how many people died in Russia. You don\u2019t know how many people died in India. They don\u2019t exactly give you a straight count, just so you understand. But if you look at what we\u2019ve done, I closed it and you said, \u201cHe\u2019s xenophobic. He\u2019s a racist and he\u2019s xenophobic,\u201d because you didn\u2019t think I should have closed our country. Wait a minute.","167":" Sir, it\u2019s his two minutes.","168":" You didn\u2019t think we should have closed our country because you thought it was terrible. You wouldn\u2019t have closed it for another two months. By my doing it early, in fact, Dr. Fauci said, \u201cPresident Trump saved thousands of lives.\u201d Many of your Democrat Governors said, \u201cPresident Trump did a phenomenal job.\u201d We worked with the Governor. Oh really, go take a look. The Governors said I did a phenomenal job. Most of them said that. In fact, people that would not be necessarily on my side said that, \u201cPresident Trump did a phenomenal job.\u201d We did. We got the gowns. We got the masks. We made the ventilators. You wouldn\u2019t have made ventilators. And now we\u2019re weeks away from a vaccine. We\u2019re doing therapeutics already. Fewer people are dying when they get sick. Far fewer people are dying. We\u2019ve done a great job.","169":" The only thing I haven\u2019t done a good job, and that\u2019s because of the fake news, no matter what you say to them, they give you a bad press on it. It\u2019s just fake news. They give you good press, they give me bad press because that\u2019s the way it is, unfortunately. But let me just say something. I don\u2019t care. I\u2019ve gotten used to it. But I\u2019ll tell you, Joe, you could never have done the job that we did. You don\u2019t have it in your blood. You could\u2019ve never done that, Joe.","170":"I know how to do the job. I know how to get the job done.","171":" Well, you didn\u2019t do very well in Swine Flu. H1-N1, you were a disaster. Your own Chief of Staff said you were a disaster.","172":"14,000 people died, not 200,000.","173":" A far less lethal disease, by the way.","174":" Sir, you made a point. Let him answer it.","175":"And there was no one \u2026 We didn\u2019t shut down the economy. This is his economy he shut down. The reason it\u2019s shut down is because, look, you folks at home. How many of you got up this morning and had an empty chair at the kitchen table because someone died of COVID? How many of you are in a situation where you lost your mom or dad and you couldn\u2019t even speak to them, you had a nurse holding a phone up so you could in fact say goodbye?","176":" We would have lost far more people, far more people. You would have been months late. You\u2019re months behind me, Joe.","177":"His own CDC Director says we could lose as many as another 200,000 people between now and the end of the year. And he said, if we just wear a mask, we can save half those numbers. Just a mask. And by the way, in terms of the whole notion of a vaccine, we\u2019re for a vaccine, but I don\u2019t trust him at all. Nor do you. I know you don\u2019t. What we trust is a scientist.","178":" You don\u2019t trust Johnson & Johnson, Pfizer? Part 2","179":"Okay, gentlemen, gentlemen. Let me move on to questions about the future because you both have touched on two of the questions I\u2019m going to ask. Focusing on the future first, President Trump, you have repeatedly either contradicted or been at odds with some of your governments own top scientists. The week before last, the Head of the Centers for Disease Control, Dr. Redfield said it would be summer before the vaccine would become generally available to the public. You said that he was confused and mistaken. Those were your two words. But Dr. Slaoui, the head of your Operation Warp Speed, has said exactly the same thing. Are they both wrong?","180":" Well, I\u2019ve spoken to the companies and we can have it a lot sooner. It\u2019s a very political thing because people like this would rather make it political than save lives.","181":"God.","182":" It is a very political thing. I\u2019ve spoken to Pfizer, I\u2019ve spoken to all of the people that you have to speak to, Moderna, Johnson & Johnson, and others. They can go faster than that by a lot. It\u2019s become very political because the left\u2026 Or I don\u2019t know if I call them left, I don\u2019t know what I call them.","183":" So you\u2019re suggesting that the head of your Operation Warp Speed, Dr. Slaoui-","184":" I disagree with him. No, I disagree with both of them. And he didn\u2019t say that. He said it could be there, but it could also be much sooner. I had him in my office two days ago.","185":" He talked about the summer, sir, before it\u2019s generally available, just like Dr. Redfield.","186":" Because he said it\u2019s a possibility that we\u2019ll have the answer before November 1st. It could also be after that.","187":" I\u2019m talking about when it\u2019s generally available, not-","188":" Well, we\u2019re going to deliver it right away. We have the military all set up. Logistically, they\u2019re all set up. We have our military that delivers soldiers and they can do 200,000 a day. They\u2019re going to be delivering-","189":"This is the same man who told you-","190":" It\u2019s all set up.","191":"\u2026 by Easter, this would be gone away. By the warm weather, it\u2019d be gone. Miraculous, like a miracle. And by the way, maybe you could inject some bleach in your arm, and that would take care of it. This is the same man.","192":" That was said sarcastically, and you know that. That was said sarcastically.","193":"So here\u2019s the deal. This man is talking about a vaccine. Every serious company is talking about maybe having a vaccine done by the end of the year, but the distribution of that vaccine will not occur until sometime beginning of the middle of next year to get it out, if we get the vaccine. And pray God we will. Pray God we will.","194":" Mr. Vice President, I want to pick up-","195":" You\u2019ll have the vaccine sooner than that.","196":" I want to pick up on this question though. You say the public can trust the scientists, but they can\u2019t trust President Trump. In fact, you said that again tonight. Your running mate, Senator Harris, goes further, saying that public health experts quote, \u201cWill be muzzled, will be suppressed.\u201d Given the fact that polls already show that people are concerned about the vaccine and are reluctant to take it, are you and your running mate, Senator Harris, contributing to that fear?","197":"No more than the question you just asked him. You pointed out he puts pressure and disagrees with his own scientists.","198":" But you\u2019re saying you can\u2019t-","199":"Everybody knows-","200":" Or Senator Harris is saying you can\u2019t trust the scientist.","201":"Well, no, no. You can trust the scientist. She didn\u2019t say that. You can trust the-","202":" She said that public health experts quote, \u201cWill be muzzled, will be suppressed.\u201d","203":"Yes. Well, that\u2019s what he\u2019s going to try to do, but there\u2019s thousands of scientists out there, like here at this great hospital that don\u2019t work for him. Their job doesn\u2019t depend on him. They\u2019re the people\u2026 And by the way-","204":" We spoke to the scientists that are in charge-","205":"By the way-","206":" \u2026 they will have the vaccine very soon.","207":" Let him finish.","208":"Do you believe for a moment what he\u2019s telling you in light of all the lies he\u2019s told you about the whole issue relating to COVID? He still hasn\u2019t even acknowledged that he knew this was happening, knew how dangerous it was going to be back in February, and he didn\u2019t even tell you. He\u2019s on record as saying it. He panicked or he just looked at the stock market. One of the two. Because guess what? A lot of people died and a lot more are going to die unless he gets a lot smarter, a lot quicker-","209":" Mr. President?","210":" Did you use the word smart? So you said you went to Delaware State, but you forgot the name of your college. You didn\u2019t go to Delaware State. You graduated either the lowest or almost the lowest in your class. Don\u2019t ever use the word smart with me. Don\u2019t ever use that word.","211":"Oh, give me a break.","212":" Because you know what? There\u2019s nothing smart about you, Joe. 47 years you\u2019ve done nothing.","213":"Well, let\u2019s have this debate-","214":" Let me just tell you something, Joe. If you would have had the charge of what I was put through, I had to close the greatest economy of the history of our country. And by the way, now it\u2019s being built again and it\u2019s going up fast.","215":" We\u2019ll get to the economy in the next segment, sir.","216":" Okay. It\u2019s going up fast. I look forward to talking about it.","217":" Okay. When it comes to how the virus has been handled so far, the two of you have taken very different approaches, and this is going to affect how the virus is handled going forward by whichever of you ends up becoming the next president. I want to quickly go through several of those. Reopenings. Vice President Biden, you have been much more reluctant than President Trump about reopening the economy and schools. Why, sir?","218":"Because he doesn\u2019t have a plan. If I were running it, I\u2019d know what the plan is. You\u2019ve got to provide these businesses the ability to have the money to be able to reopen with the PPE, as well as with the sanitation they need. You have to provide them classic-","219":" Tell that to Nancy Pelosi.","220":"Will he just shush for a minute?","221":" Tell that to Nancy Pelosi, and Schumer [crosstalk 000452] Chuck.","222":"Nancy Pelosi and Schumer, they have a plan. He won\u2019t even meet with them. The Republicans won\u2019t meet in the Senate. He sits in his golf course. Well, I mean, literally, think about it. Think about it.","223":" You probably play more than I do, Joe.","224":" What about this question of reopenings and the fact-","225":" Well, he wants to shut down this country and I want to keep it open, and we did a great thing by shutting it down-","226":"You just admitted you\u2019d shut it down.","227":" Wait a minute, Joe. Let me shut you down for a second, Joe, just for one second. He wants to shut down the country. We just went through it. We had to, because we didn\u2019t know anything about the disease. Now we\u2019ve found that elderly people with heart problems and diabetes and different problems are very, very vulnerable. We learned a lot. Young children aren\u2019t, even younger people aren\u2019t. We\u2019ve learned a lot, but he wants to shut it down. More people will be hurt by continuing. If you look at Pennsylvania, if you look at certain states that have been shut down, they have Democrat governors, all, one of the reasons they shut down is because they want to keep it shut down until after the election on November 3rd.","228":" All right. I want to move onto another-","229":" Because it\u2019s a political thing.","230":" I want to move onto another subject.","231":"I got to respond to that.","232":" I want to move-","233":" But those states-","234":" Gentlemen, I want to move onto another subject.","235":" Those states are not doing well that are shut down right now.","236":"I got to respond to that.","237":" He wants to shut down the whole country.","238":" President Trump, you have begun to increasingly question the effectiveness of masks as a disease preventer. And in fact, recently you have cited the issue of waiters touching their masks and touching plates. Are you questioning the efficacy of masks?","239":" No, I think masks are okay. You have to understand, if you look\u2026 I mean, I have a mask right here. I put a mask on when I think I need it. Tonight, as an example, everybody\u2019s had a test and you\u2019ve had social distancing and all of the things that you have to, but I wear masks-","240":"Just like your rally.","241":" \u2026 when needed. When needed, I wear masks.","242":" Okay. Let me ask-","243":" I don\u2019t wear a mask like him. Every time you see him, he\u2019s got a mask. He could be speaking 200 feet away from him and he shows up with the biggest mask I\u2019ve ever seen. I will say this-","244":" Vice President Biden, go ahead, sir.","245":"Look, the way to open businesses is give them the wherewithal to be able open. We provided money, the-","246":" But I was asking you, sir, about masks.","247":"Well, masks make a big difference. His own head of the CDC said if we just wore masks between now, if everybody wore a mask and social distanced between now and January, we\u2019d probably save up to 100,000 lives. It matters. It matters.","248":" And they\u2019ve also said the opposite. They\u2019ve also said-","249":"No serious person has said the opposite. No serious person.","250":" Okay. I want to ask you-","251":" Dr. Fauci. Dr. Fauci said the opposite.","252":"He did not say the opposite.","253":" I want to ask you, we\u2019ve got a little than a minute left in this segment.","254":" He said very strongly, \u201cMasks are not good.\u201d Then he changed his mind. He said, \u201cMasks are good.\u201d","255":" I want to ask-","256":" I\u2019m okay with masks. I\u2019m not fighting masks.","257":" I want to ask you both about one last subject because your different approaches has even affected the way that you have campaigned. President Trump, you\u2019re holding large rallies with crowds packed together, thousands of people.","258":" Outside.","259":" Outside. Yes, sir. Agreed. Vice President Biden, you are holding much smaller events with-","260":" Because nobody will show up.","261":" \u2026 people with masks.","262":" Well, it\u2019s true. Nobody shows up to his rallies.","263":" All right. In any case, why you holding the big rallies? Why you not? You go first, sir.","264":" Because people want to hear what I have to say. I mean-","265":" But are not worried about us spreading disease?","266":" \u2026 I\u2019m doing my job as a president, and I\u2019ll have 25, 35,000 people show up at airports. We use airports and hangers and we have a lot of people-","267":" Are you not worried about the disease issues, sir?","268":" Well, so far we have had no problem whatsoever. It\u2019s outside. That\u2019s a big difference according to the experts. We do them outside, we have tremendous crowds, as you see, and literally on 24 hours notice. And Joe does the circles and has three people someplace.","269":"By the way, did you see one of the last big rallies he had? A reporter came up to him to ask him a question, he said, \u201cNo, no, no. Stand back, put on your mask, put on a mask. Have you been tested? I\u2019m way far away from those other people.\u201d That\u2019s what he said, \u201cI\u2019m going to be okay.\u201d He\u2019s not worried about you. He\u2019s not worried about the people out there [crosstalk 000848].","270":" We\u2019ve had no negative effect.","271":"No negative effect. Come on.","272":" We\u2019ve had no negative effect, and we\u2019ve had 35, 40,000 people at these rallies.","273":" All right. Do you want to just quickly finish up? Because I want to move on to our next-","274":"Yes, I would. He\u2019s been totally irresponsible the way in which he has handled the social distancing and people wearing masks, basically encouraged them not to. He\u2019s a fool on this.","275":" If you could get the crowds, you would have done the same thing. But you can\u2019t. Nobody cares.","276":" Gentlemen, can we move on to the-","277":" No cares.","278":" Gentlemen, can we move on to the economy?","279":" Yes.","280":" The economy is, I think it\u2019s fair to say, recovering faster than expected from the shutdown-","281":" Much faster.","282":" \u2026 in the second quarter. The unemployment rate fell to 8.4% last month. The Federal Reserve says the hit to growth, which is going to be there, is not going to be nearly as big as they had expected. President Trump, you say we are in a V-shaped recovery. Vice President Biden, you say it\u2019s more of a K-shape. What difference does that mean to the American people in terms of the economy? President Trump, in this segment you go first.","283":" So we built the greatest economy in history. We closed it down because of the China plague. When the plague came in, we closed it down, which was very hard psychologically to do. He didn\u2019t think we should close it down and he was wrong. Again, two million people would be dead now instead of\u2026 Still, 204,000 people is too much. One person is too much. Should have never happened from China. But what happened is we closed it down and now we\u2019re reopening and we\u2019re doing record business. We had 10.4 million people in a four month period that we\u2019ve put back into the workforce. That\u2019s a record the likes of which nobody\u2019s ever seen before. And he wants to close down the\u2026 He will shut it down again. He will destroy this country.","284":" A lot of people, between drugs and alcohol and depression, when you start shutting it down, you take a look at what\u2019s happening at some of your Democrat-run states where they have these tough shutdowns. And I\u2019m telling you it\u2019s because they don\u2019t want to open it. One of them came out last week, you saw that, \u201cOh, we\u2019re going to open up on November 9th.\u201d Why November 9th? Because it\u2019s after the election. They think they\u2019re hurting us by keeping them closed. They\u2019re hurting people. People know what to do. They can social distance. They can wash their hands, they can wear masks. They can do whatever they want, but they got to open these states up.","285":" When you look at North Carolina, when you look, and these governors are under siege, Pennsylvania, Michigan, and a couple of others, you got to open these states up. It\u2019s not fair. You\u2019re talking about almost it\u2019s like being in prison. And you look at what\u2019s going on with divorce, look at what\u2019s going on with alcoholism and drugs. It\u2019s a very, very sad thing. And he\u2019ll close down the whole country. This guy will close down the whole country and destroy our country. Our country is coming back incredibly well, setting records as it does it. We don\u2019t need somebody to come in and say, \u201cLet\u2019s shut it down.\u201d","286":" All right. Your two minutes, sir. We\u2019re now moved to you. As I said, posing the question, the president says it\u2019s a V-shape recovery, you say it\u2019s a K-shaped recovery. What\u2019s the difference?","287":"The difference is millionaires and billionaires like him in the middle of the COVID crisis have done very well. Billionaires have made another $300 billion because of his profligate tax proposal, and he only focused on the market. But you folks at home, you folks living in Scranton and Claymont and all the small towns and working class towns in America, how well are you doing? This guy paid a total of $750 in taxes.","288":" That\u2019s wrong.","289":" Sir, wait. No. Sir-","290":" [crosstalk 001219].","291":" Yeah, I understand. You\u2019ve agreed to the two minutes, so please let him have it.","292":"Do I get my time back? The fact is that he has in fact, worked on this in a way that he\u2019s going to be the first president of the United States to leave office, having fewer jobs in his administration than when he became president. Fewer jobs than when he became president. First one in American history.","293":"Secondly, the people who have lost their jobs are those people who have been on the front lines. Those people who have been saving our lives, those people who have been out there dying. People who\u2019ve been putting themselves in the way to make sure that we could all try to make it. And the idea that he is insisting that we go forward and open when you have almost half the states in America with a significant increase in COVID deaths and COVID cases in the United States of America, and he wants to open it up more. Why is he want to open it up? Why does he take care of the\u2026 You can\u2019t fix the economy until you fix the COVID crisis. And he has no intention of doing anything about making it better for you all at home in terms of your health and your safety.","294":"Schools. Why aren\u2019t schools open? Because it costs a lot of money to open them safely. They were going to give, his administration going to give the teachers and school students masks, and then they decided no, couldn\u2019t do that because it\u2019s not a national emergency. Not a national emergency. They\u2019ve done nothing to help small businesses. Nothing. They\u2019re closing. One in six is now gone. He ought to get on the job and take care of the needs of the American people so we can open safely.","295":" All right. Your time is up, sir. We are going to get to-","296":" I have to respond to that.","297":" Well, you both had two minutes, sir.","298":" Excuse me, he made a statement.","299":" And so did you.","300":" No, people want their schools open. They don\u2019t want to be shut down. They don\u2019t want their state shut down. They want their restaurants. I look at New York. It\u2019s so sad what\u2019s happening in New York. It\u2019s almost like a ghost town, and I\u2019m not sure it can ever recover what they\u2019ve done to New York. People want their places open. They want to get back to their lives.","301":"People want to be safe.","302":" They\u2019ll be careful, but they want their schools open.","303":"People want to be safe.","304":" I\u2019m the one that brought back football. By the way, I brought back Big Ten football. It was me and I\u2019m very happy to do it-","305":" All right. Let\u2019s-","306":" \u2026 and people of Ohio are very proud of me. And you know how I found out? When [crosstalk 001435].","307":" Gentlemen, we\u2019re going to get to your economic plans going forward in a moment, but first, Mr. President, as you well know, there\u2019s a new report that in 2016, the year you were elected president, and 2017, your first year as president, that you paid $750 a year in federal income tax each of those years. I know that you pay a lot of other taxes, but I\u2019m asking you this specific question. Is it true that you paid $750 in federal income taxes each of those two years?","308":" I paid millions of dollars in taxes, millions of dollars of income tax. And let me just tell you, there was a story in one of the papers that paid-","309":"Show us your tax returns.","310":" I paid $38 million one year, I paid $27 million one year.","311":"Show us your tax returns.","312":" You\u2019ll see it as soon as it\u2019s finished, you\u2019ll see it. You know, if you wanted to, go to the Board of Elections. There\u2019s 118 page or so report that says everything I have, every bank I have, I\u2019m totally under leveraged because the assets are extremely good, and I built a great company.","313":" Sir, I\u2019m asking you a specific question, which is-","314":" But let me tell you-","315":" I understand all of that.","316":"Release your tax return.","317":" I understand all of that-","318":" Let me-","319":" No, Mr. President, I\u2019m asking you a question. Will you tell us how much you paid in federal income taxes in 2016 and 2017?","320":" Millions of dollars.","321":" You paid millions of dollars in-","322":" Millions of dollars, yes.","323":" So not 750?","324":" Millions of dollars. And you\u2019ll get to see it. And you\u2019ll get to see it.","325":"When? Inshallah?","326":" But let me just tell you-","327":"In [crosstalk 001604]?","328":" Chris, let me just say something, that it was the tax laws. I don\u2019t want to pay tax. Before I came here, I was a private developer, I was a private business people. Like every other private person, unless they\u2019re stupid, they go through the laws, and that\u2019s what it is. He passed a tax bill that gave us all these privileges for depreciation and for tax credits. We build the building and we get tax credits, like the hotel on Pennsylvania Avenue. Which by the way, was given to me by the Obama administration, if you can believe that. Now the man got fired right after that happened, but that\u2019s-","329":" Vice President Biden, you want to respond?","330":"Yeah, I do want to respond. Look, the tax code that put him in a position that he pays less tax than on the money a school teacher makes is because of him\u2026 He says he\u2019s smart because he can take advantage of the tax code. And he does take advantage of the tax code. That\u2019s why I\u2019m going to eliminate the Trump tax cuts. And I\u2019m going to eliminate those tax cuts.","331":" That\u2019s okay.","332":"And make sure that we invest in the people who in fact need the help. People out there need help.","333":" But why didn\u2019t you do it over the last 25 years?","334":"Because you weren\u2019t president-","335":" Why didn\u2019t you do it over the last 25 years?","336":"Because you weren\u2019t president and screwing things up.","337":" You were a Senator and [crosstalk 001721]-","338":"You\u2019re the worst president America has ever had. Come on.","339":" Hey, Joe, let me just tell you, Joe. In 47 months, I\u2019ve done more than you\u2019ve done in 47 years, Joe. We\u2019ve done things that you never even thought of doing.","340":" Okay. Gentlemen?","341":" Including fixing the broken military that you gave me, including taking care of your debts.","342":" Mr. President, we\u2019re talking about the economy. I\u2019d like to ask you about your plans going forward because Mr. Vice President, your economic plan-","343":" He has none.","344":" \u2026 if you were to be elected president focuses a lot on big government, big taxes, big spending. I want to focus first on the taxes. You propose more than $4 trillion over a decade in new taxes on individuals making more than $400,000 a year.","345":" \u2026 on individuals making more than $400,000 a year and on corporations. President Trump says that that kind of an increase in taxes is going to hurt the economy as it\u2019s just coming out of a recession.","346":"Well, just take a look at what is the analysis done by Wall Street firms, points out that my economic plan would create 7 million more jobs than his in four years, number one. And number two, it would create an additional $1 trillion in economic growth, because it would be about buying American. The federal government spends $600 billion a year on everything from ships, to steel, to buildings and the like. And under my proposal, we\u2019re going to make sure that every penny of that has to be made by a company-","347":" But respectfully, sir, I\u2019m talking about taxes, not spending.","348":"By the way, I\u2019m going to eliminate a significant number of the taxes. I\u2019m going to make the corporate tax 28%. It shouldn\u2019t be 21%. You have 91 companies federal, I mean, the fortune 500, who don\u2019t pay a single penny in tax making billions of dollars.","349":" Why didn\u2019t you do it before, when you were vice president with Obama?","350":"Because you in fact passed that, that was your tax proposal.","351":" I got it done. And you know what happened?","352":"Yeah, you got it done-","353":" Our economy boomed like it\u2019s never boomed before.","354":"The economy-","355":" Mr. President-","356":"Let me finish.","357":" Mr. President, let me pick up on that. You would continue your free market approach, lower taxes, more deregulation, correct?","358":"Not lower tax for the American people.","359":" But let me-","360":" Excuse me.","361":" You talk about the economy booming. It turns out that in Obama\u2019s final three years as president more jobs were created, a million and a half more jobs, than in the first three years of your presidency.","362":" They had the slowest economic recovery since 1929. It was the slowest recovery. Also, they took over something that was down here. All you had to do is turn on the lights and you pick up a lot. But they had the slowest economic recovery since 1929, and let me tell you about the stock market. When the stock market goes up, that means jobs. It also means 401ks. If you got in, if you ever became president with your ideas, you want to terminate my taxes. I\u2019ll tell you what, you\u2019ll lose. Half of the companies that have poured in here will leave. And plenty of companies that are already here, they\u2019ll leave for other places. [crosstalk 002025] They will leave and you will have a depression, the likes of which you\u2019ve never seen.","363":"Look-","364":" Mr. Vice President.","365":"\u2026 we inherited the worst recession, short of a depression in American history. I was asked to bring it back. We were able to have an economic recovery that created the jobs you\u2019re talking about. We handed him a booming economy, he blew it.","366":" It wasn\u2019t blooming.","367":"He blew it.","368":" He was in booming. It was the weakest recovery since 1929.","369":" Wait, wait, is it fair to say he blew it when, in fact-","370":" When COVID came along.","371":" \u2026 when there was record low unemployment before COVID.","372":"Yeah, because what he did, even before COVID, manufacturing went in the hole. Manufacturing went in a hole-","373":" Excuse me, Chris, wait.","374":"\u2026 number one. Number two-","375":" Chris.","376":"Number three.","377":" They said it would take\u2026 No, you\u2019re on number two.","378":"No.","379":" Chris, Chris. They said it would take-","380":"This guy-","381":" \u2026 a miracle to bring back manufacturing. I brought back 700,000 jobs. They brought back nothing. They gave up on manufacturing.","382":"We did not. [crosstalk 002121]","383":" \u2026 standard fare.","384":"I\u2019m the guy that brought back the automobile industry.","385":" He totally gave up on manufacturing.","386":" All right, let him-","387":"I was asked to bring back Chrysler and General Motors. He brought them back right here in the state of Ohio and Michigan. He blew it. They\u2019re gone. He blew it. And in fact, they\u2019re gone-","388":" Ohio had the best year it\u2019s ever had last year. Michigan had the best year they\u2019ve ever had.","389":"That is not true.","390":" Many car companies came in from Germany, from Japan, went to Michigan, went to Ohio and they didn\u2019t come in with you. [crosstalk 002147].","391":" Mr. Vice President, go ahead.","392":"And so you take a look at what he\u2019s actually done. He\u2019s done very little. His trade deals are the same way. He talks about these great trade deals. He talks about the art of the deal. China\u2019s perfected the art of the steel. We have a higher deficit with China now than we did before. We have the highest trade deficit-","393":" China ate your lunch- [crosstalk 00002207].","394":"\u2026 with Mexico.","395":" China ate your lunch, Joe. And no wonder your son goes in and he takes out billions of dollars. He takes out billions of dollars to manage. He makes millions of dollars. And also, while we\u2019re at it, why is it just out of curiosity, the mayor of Moscow\u2019s wife gave you a son three and a half million dollars?","396":"That is not true.","397":" What did he do to deserve it? What did he do with-","398":"None of that is true.","399":" \u2026 to deserve $183,000?","400":" Sir, you\u2019ve asked him a question, let him answer it.","401":"None of that is true.","402":" Oh really, he didn\u2019t get three and a half million?","403":" Mr. President-","404":"Is totally-","405":" Mr. President, please. You\u2019ve asked a question- [crosstalk 002241]","406":"Totally discredited. Totally discredited. And by the way-","407":" Well wait, he didn\u2019t get three and a half million dollars, Joe?","408":"Mr. Vice-","409":" He got three and a half million-","410":" Mr. President.","411":" \u2026 dollars.","412":"That is not true.","413":" Oh, really?","414":" Mr. President, it\u2019s an open discussion. Please- [crosstalk 002256]","415":" It\u2019s a fact.","416":"It is not a fact.","417":" Well, you have raised an issue, let the Vice President answer.","418":"It\u2019s been totally discredited.","419":" Did Burisma pay him 183,000 a month, with no experience in energy?","420":" Mr. President-","421":"My son did nothing wrong at Barisma-","422":" I think he did.","423":" Mr. President, let him answer. [crosstalk 002313].","424":"He doesn\u2019t want to let me answer, because he knows I have the truth. His position has been totally thoroughly discredited-","425":" By who?","426":"And you can-","427":" The media.","428":"by everybody. Well, by the media, by our allies.","429":" By the media, because they refuse to talk about it-","430":"By the World Bank-","431":" \u2026 because they\u2019re embarrassed.","432":"By everyone, has discredited. And matter of fact [crosstalk 002330] Matter of fact-","433":" Mr. President, please stop.","434":"Even the people who testified under oath-","435":" So let me ask you this, Joe- [crosstalk 002335].","436":" Go ahead, I\u2019m listening to you.","437":"Even the people under-","438":" He got three and a half million dollars from Moscow.","439":"\u2026 testified under oath in his administration said I did my job and I did it very well.","440":" Oh, really?","441":"I did it honorably.","442":" I\u2019d like to know who they are.","443":"Well, I\u2019ll give you the list of the people who-","444":" I\u2019ll fire them.","445":" No, no. Go ahead, sir.","446":"I\u2019m sure that you\u2019ve already fired most of them, because they did a good job.","447":" Some people don\u2019t do a good job.","448":"Well, here\u2019s the- [crosstalk 002357]","449":" Go ahead. You get the- [crosstalk 002357] Wait a minute. You get the final word, Mr.-","450":"Well, it\u2019s hard to get any word in with this clown. Excuse me, this person.","451":" Hey, let me just tell you, Joe-","452":"No, no. Mr. President- [crosstalk 002405]","453":" Three and a half million, Joe.","454":"That is simply not true.","455":" Why did he deserve three and a half million from Moscow?","456":"Look, here\u2019s the deal. We want to talk about families and ethics. I don\u2019t want to do that. I mean, his family, we could talk about all night. His family\u2019s already-","457":" My family-","458":" No, no- [crosstalk 000620].","459":" My family lost a fortune by coming down and helping us with governance.","460":"And that\u2019s such a- [crosstalk 002425]","461":" Mr. President-","462":" Every single one of them lost a fortune-","463":"This is not about my family or his family. It\u2019s about your family, the American people. [crosstalk 002432] That\u2019s not true. It doesn\u2019t want to talk about what you need. You, the American people, it\u2019s about you. That\u2019s what we\u2019re talking about here. [crosstalk 002442]","464":" That\u2019s the end of the segment. We\u2019re moving on.","465":"He didn\u2019t take that.","466":" Vice President-","467":" Chris, can I be honest? It\u2019s a very important question-","468":"Try to be honest.","469":" No.","470":" He stood up-","471":" The answer to the question is no.","472":" \u2026 and the threatened Ukraine-","473":" Sir-","474":" \u2026 with a billion dollars-","475":"That is absolutely not true.","476":" Stop. [crosstalk 002502] Gentlemen, I hate to raise my voice, but I- [crosstalk 002505] Why should I be different than the two of you? So here\u2019s the deal.","477":"That\u2019s a good point.","478":" We have six segments. We have ended that segment. We\u2019re going to go to the next segment. In that segment, you each are going to have two uninterrupted moments. In those two interrupted minutes, Mr. President, you can say anything you want. I\u2019m going to ask a question about race, but if you want to answer about something else, go ahead. But I think that the country would be better served, if we allowed both people to speak with fewer interruptions. I\u2019m appealing to you, sir, to do that.","479":" Well, and him too.","480":" Well, frankly, you\u2019ve been doing more interrupting than he has.","481":" Well, that\u2019s all right, but he does plenty.","482":" Well, sir, less than-","483":" He does plenty.","484":" No, less than you have. Let\u2019s please continue on. The issue of rice. Vice-President Biden, you say that President Trump\u2019s response to the violence in Charlottesville three years ago, when he talked about very fine people on both sides, was what directly led you to launch this run for president.","485":" Oh yeah, sure.","486":" President Trump, you have often said that you believe you will have done more for Black Americans than any president with the possible exception of Abraham Lincoln.","487":" That\u2019s true.","488":" My question for the two of you, is why should voters trust you rather than your opponent to deal with the race issues facing this country over the next four years? Vice President Biden, you go first.","489":"It\u2019s about equity and equality. It\u2019s about decency. It\u2019s about the constitution. And we have never walked away from trying to require equity for everyone, equality for the whole of America. But we\u2019ve never accomplished it, but we\u2019ve never walked away from it like he has done. It is true, the reason I got in the race is when those people\u2026 Close your eyes, remember what those people look like coming out of the fields, carrying torches, their veins bulging, just spewing anti-Semitic bile and accompanied by the Ku Klux Klan. A young woman got killed and they asked the president what he thought. He said, \u201cThere were very fine people on both sides.\u201d No president\u2019s ever said anything like that. [crosstalk 002710].","490":" It is his-","491":"Now-","492":" \u2026 minute sir.","493":"\u2026 second point I\u2019d make to you, is that when Floyd was killed, when Mr. Floyd was killed, there was a peaceful protest in front of the White House. What did he do? He came out of his bunker, had the military use tear gas on them so he could walk across to a church and hold up a Bible. And then what happened after that? The Bishop of that very church said that it was a disgrace. The general who was with him said all he ever wants to do is divide people, not unite people at all. This is a president who has used everything as a dog whistle, to try to generate racists hatred, racist division.","494":"This is a man who, in fact, you talk about helping African-Americans, one in 1000 African Americans has been killed because of the coronavirus. And if he doesn\u2019t do something quickly, by the end of the year, one in 500 will have been killed. One in 500 African Americans. This man is as a savior of African-Americans? This man cares at all? This man\u2019s done virtually nothing. Look, the fact is that you have to look at what he talks about. You have to look at what he did. And what he did has been disastrous for the African-American community.","495":" So-","496":" President Trump, you have two minutes. Why should Americans trust you over your opponent to deal race issues?","497":" You did a crime bill, 1994, where you call them super predators. African-Americans are super predators and they\u2019ve never forgotten it. They\u2019ve never forgotten it.","498":"I\u2019ve never said-","499":" No, no, sir. It\u2019s his two minutes.","500":" So you did that and they call you a super predator and I\u2019m letting people out of jail now, that you have treated the African-American population community, you have treated the black community about as bad as anybody in this country. You did the 1990\u2026 And that\u2019s why, if you look at the polls, I\u2019m doing better than any Republican has done in a long time, because they saw what you did. You call them super predators, and you\u2019ve called them worse than that. Because you look back at your testimony over the years, you\u2019ve called them a lot worse than that. As far as the church is concerned and as far as the generals are concerned, we just got the support of 250 military leaders and generals, total support. Law enforcement, almost every law enforcement group in the United States. I have Florida. I have Texas. I have Ohio. I have every\u2026 Excuse me, Portland, the sheriff just came out today and he said, \u201cI support President Trump.\u201d","501":" I don\u2019t think you have any law enforcement. You can\u2019t even say the word law enforcement. Because if you say those words, you\u2019re going to lose all of your radical left supporters. And why aren\u2019t you saying those words, Joe? Why don\u2019t you say the words law enforcement? Because you know what? If called us in Portland, we would put out that fire in a half an hour. But they won\u2019t do it, because they\u2019re run by radical left Democrats. If you look at Chicago, if you look at any place you want to look, Seattle, they heard we were coming in the following day and they put up their hands and we got back Seattle. Minneapolis, we got it back, Joe, because we believe in law and order, but you don\u2019t. The top 10 cities and just about the top 40 cities are run by Democrats, and in many cases radical left. And they\u2019ve got you wrapped around their finger, Joe, to a point where you don\u2019t want to say anything about law and order. And I\u2019ll tell you what, the people of this country want and demand law and order and you\u2019re afraid to even say it.","502":" All right. I want to return to the question of race. Vice President Biden, after the grand jury in the Breonna Taylor case decided not to charge any of the police with homicide, you said it raises the question, \u201cWhether justice could be equally applied in America.\u201d Do you believe that there is a separate but unequal system of justice for Blacks in this country?","503":"Yes, there is. There\u2019s systemic injustice in this country, in education and work and in law enforcement and the way in which it\u2019s enforced. But look, the vast majority of police officers are good, decent, honorable men and women. They risk their lives every day to take care of us, but there are some bad apples. And when they occur, when they find them, they have to be sorted out. They have to be held accountable. They have to be held accountable. And what I\u2019m going to do as President of the United States is call together an entire group of people at the White House, everything from the civil rights groups, to the police officers, to the police chiefs, and we\u2019re going to work this out.","504":"We\u2019re going to work this out. So we changed the way in which we have more transparency, in when these things happen. These cops aren\u2019t happy to see what happened to George Floyd. These cops aren\u2019t happy to see what happened to Breonna Taylor. Most don\u2019t like it, but we have to have a system where people are held accountable when\u2026 And by the way, violence in response is never appropriate, never appropriate. Peaceful protest is, violence is never appropriate.","505":" All right, Mr.-","506":" What is peaceful protest? When they run through the middle of the town-","507":" President Trump-","508":" \u2026 and burn down your stores and kill people all over the place- [crosstalk 003214].","509":"That is not peaceful protest.","510":" No it\u2019s not, but you say it is.","511":" President Trump, I\u2019d like to continue with the issue of race. I promise we\u2019re going to get to the issue of law and order in a moment.","512":" Fine.","513":" This month, your administration directed federal agencies to end racial sensitivity training that addresses white privilege or critical race theory. Why did you decide to do that, to end racial sensitivity training? And do you believe that there is systemic racism in this country, sir?","514":" I ended it because it\u2019s racist. I ended it because a lot of people were complaining that they were asked to do things that were absolutely insane. That it a radical revolution that was taking place in our military, in our schools, all over the place. And you know it, and so does everybody else. And he would know it- [crosstalk 003302]","515":" What is radical about racial sensitivity training?","516":" If you were a certain person, you had no status in life. It was sort of a reversal. And if you look at the people, we were paying people hundreds of thousands of dollars to teach very bad ideas and frankly, very sick ideas. And really, they were teaching people to hate our country And I\u2019m not going to do that. I\u2019m not going to allow that to happen. We have to go back to the core values of this country. They were teaching people that our country is a horrible place. It\u2019s a racist place. And they were teaching people to hate our country. And I\u2019m not going to allow that to happen.","517":" Vice President Biden.","518":"Nobody\u2019s doing that. He\u2019s the racist.","519":" You just don\u2019t know.","520":"Here\u2019s the deal. I know a lot more about this- [crosstalk 001543].","521":" Let him finish.","522":"The fact is that there is racial insensitivity. People have to be made aware of what other people feel like, what insults them, what is demeaning to them. It\u2019s important people know. Many people don\u2019t want to hurt other people\u2019s feelings, but it makes a big difference. It makes a gigantic difference in the way a child is able to grow up and have a sense of self-esteem. It\u2019s a little bit like how this guy and his friends look down on so many people. They look down their nose on people like Irish Catholics, like me, who grow up in Scranton. They look down on people who don\u2019t have money. They look down on people who are of a different faith. They looked down on people who are a different color. In fact, we\u2019re all Americans. The only way we\u2019re going to bring this country together is bring everybody together. There\u2019s nothing we cannot do, if we do it together. We can take this on and we can defeat racism in American.","523":" Vice President\u2026 I mean, President Trump, sir.","524":" During the Obama-Biden administration, there was tremendous division. There was hatred. You look at Ferguson, you look at, or you go to very\u2026 Many places, look at Oakland. Look what happened in Oakland. Look what happened in Baltimore. Look what happened\u2026 Frankly, it was more violent than what I\u2019m even seeing now.","525":"Oh my Lord.","526":" But the reason-","527":"This is ridiculous.","528":" \u2026 is that the Democrats that run these cities-","529":"Absolutely ridiculous.","530":" \u2026 don\u2019t want to talk, like you, about law and order.","531":"Violent crime-","532":" And you still haven\u2019t mentioned. Are you in favor of law and order?","533":"I\u2019m in favor of law. You- [crosstalk 003515].","534":" Are you in favor of law and order? [crosstalk 003517]","535":" You asked a question, let him finish. [crosstalk 003518] Let him answer.","536":"Law and order with justice, where people get treated fairly.","537":" Okay.","538":"And the fact of the matter is, violent crime went down 17%, 15% in our administration. It\u2019s gone up on his watch.","539":" It went down much more in ours.","540":" All right, we\u2019re done- [crosstalk 003535] Mr. President, you\u2019re going to be very happy because we\u2019re now going to talk about law and order.","541":" The places we had trouble were democratic run cities-","542":" That\u2019s exactly my question. There has been a dramatic increase in homicides in America this summer particularly, and you often blame that on democratic mayors and democratic governors. But in fact, there have been equivalent spikes in Republican led cities, like Tulsa and Fort Worth. So the question is, is this really a\u2026","543":" It\u2019s like Tulsa and Fort worth. So the question is, is this really a party issue?","544":" I think as a party issue, you can bring in a couple of examples but if you look at Chicago, what\u2019s going on in Chicago where a 53 people were shot and eight died shot, if you look at New York where it\u2019s going up, like nobody\u2019s ever seen anything. The numbers are going up a 100%, 150%, 200% crime, it is crazy what\u2019s going on and he doesn\u2019t want to say law and order because he can\u2019t because he\u2019ll lose his radical left supporters and once he does that, it\u2019s over with. But if he ever got to run this country and they ran it the way he would want to run it, we would have by the way our suburbs would be gone. And you would see problems like you\u2019ve never seen before.","545":"He wouldn\u2019t know a suburb unless you took a wrong turn.","546":" Oh, I know suburbs so much that you.","547":" Gentlemen wait a minute.","548":"I was raised in the suburbs. This is not 1950. All these dog whistles and racism don\u2019t work anymore. Suburbs are by and large integrated. There\u2019s many people today driving their kids to soccer practice and\/or black and white and Hispanic in the same car as there have been any time in the past, what really is a threat to the suburbs and their safety is his failure to deal with COVID. They\u2019re dying in the suburbs. His failure to deal with the environment, they\u2019re being flooded, they\u2019re being burned out because his refusal to do anything. That\u2019s why the suburbs are in trouble.","549":" I do want to talk about this issue of law and order though. And in the joint recommendation that came from the Biden-Bernie Sanders task force, you talked about quote re-imagining policing. First of all, what does re-imagining policing mean and do you support? If I might finish the question, what does re-imagining policing mean and do you support the Black Lives Matter call for community control of policing?","550":"Look, what I support are the police having the opportunity to deal with the problems they face and I\u2019m totally opposed to defunding the police offices. As a matter of fact police, local police, the only one defunding in his budget calls for a $400 million cut in local law enforcement assistance. They need more assistance. They need when they show up for a 9-11 call to have someone with them as a psychologist or psychiatrist to keep them from having to use force and be able to talk people down. We have to have community policing like we had before where the officers get to know the people in the communities. That\u2019s when crime went down, it didn\u2019t go up. It went down. And so we have to be\u2026","551":" That\u2019s not what they are talking about this. That\u2019s not what it is about. He\u2019s talking about defunding the police.","552":"That is not true.","553":" He doesn\u2019t have any law support. He has no law enforcement.","554":"That\u2019s not true.","555":" He has almost nothing. Oh, really, who do you have name one group that supports you name one group that came out and supported you. Go ahead. Think we have time.","556":"We don\u2019t have time to do anything.","557":" No, no think right now. Name one law enforcement group that came out in support of you.","558":" Now, gentleman. I think I\u2019m going to tell I\u2019m going to take back the bottom line.","559":" There aren\u2019t any.","560":" And I want to get to another subject, which is the issue of protests in many cities that have turned violent in Portland, Oregon, especially we had more than a 100 straight days of protests, which I think you would agree, you talk about peaceful protests. Many of those turned into riots. Mr. Vice-president you say that people who commit crimes should be held accountable. The question I have though is as the democratic nominee, and earlier tonight, you said that you are the Democratic Party right now, have you ever called the Democratic Mayor of Portland or the Democratic Governor of Oregon and said, \u201cHey, you got to stop this, bring in the National Guard, do whatever it takes, but you\u2019d stop the days and months of violence in Portland.\u201d","561":"I don\u2019t hold public office. Now I am a former vice president. I\u2019ve made it clear. I\u2019ve made it clear in my public statements that the violence should be prosecuted. It should be prosecuted and anyone who committed it should be prosecuted.","562":" But you\u2019ve never called for the people\u2026","563":" He\u2019s never done that.","564":" Excuse me, sir. You had never called for the leaders in Portland and in Oregon to call and bring in the National Guard and knock off a 100 days of riots.","565":"They can in fact take care of it if he just stay out of the way.","566":" Oh really? I sent in the US Marshalls to get the killer of a young man in the middle of the street and they shot him for three days Portland didn\u2019t do anything. I sent in the US Marshals they took care of business.","567":" Go ahead sir.","568":"And by the way his own former spokesperson said, \u201cRiots and chaos and violence help he cause.\u201d That\u2019s what this is all about.","569":" I don\u2019t know who said that.","570":"I do.","571":" Who?","572":"I think Kellyanne Conway.","573":" I don\u2019t think she said that.","574":"She said that.","575":" I don\u2019t think so.","576":"Here\u2019s the point, the point is that that\u2019s why he keeps trying to rile everything up. He doesn\u2019t want to calm things down instead of going in and talking to people and saying, \u201cLet\u2019s get everybody together. Figure out how to deal with this.\u201d What\u2019s he do? He just pours gasoline in the fire constantly and every single solitary time.","577":" Okay. And to end this, button up this segment I\u2019m going to give you a minute to answer, sir. You have repeatedly criticized\u2026","578":" Does it mean I have to answer his stuff.","579":" You have repeatedly\u2026","580":" Wait a second, you have made a statement.","581":" You\u2019ve been talking back and forth. I\u2019m asking you.","582":" I would love to end it.","583":" You know sir if you want to switch seats we could very quickly can do that.","584":" I\u2019ll send in the National Guard, it would be over. That\u2019d be no problem. But I don\u2019t want to accept the National Guard.","585":" You have repeatedly criticized the vice president for not specifically calling out Antifa and other left wing extremist groups. But are you willing tonight to condemn white supremacists and militia group and to say that they need to stand down and not add to the violence in a number of these cities as we saw in Kenosha and as we\u2019ve seen in Portland.","586":" Sure, I\u2019m will to do that.","587":" Are you prepared specifically to do it.","588":" I would say almost everything I see is from the left wing not from the right wing.","589":" But what are you saying?","590":" I\u2019m willing to do anything. I want to see peace.","591":" Well, do it, sir.","592":"Say it, do it say it.","593":" What do you want to call them? Give me a name, give me a name, go ahead who do you want me to condemn.","594":" White supremacist and right-wing militia.","595":"Proud Boys.","596":" Proud Boys, stand back and stand by. But I\u2019ll tell you what somebody\u2019s got to do something about Antifa and the left because this is not a right wing problem this is a left wing\u2026","597":"His own FBI Director said unlike white supremacist, Antifa is an idea not an organization-","598":" Oh you got to be kidding me.","599":"\u2026 not a militia. That\u2019s what his FBI Director said.","600":" Well, then you know what, he\u2019s wrong.","601":" We\u2019re done, sir. Moving onto the next\u2026 [crosstalk 004246]","602":" Antifa is bad.","603":"Every body in your administration tells you the truth, it\u2019s a bad idea. You have no idea about anything.","604":" You know what, Antifa is a dangerous radical group.","605":" All right, gentlemen we\u2019re now moving onto the Trump-Biden record.","606":" And you ought to be careful of them, they\u2019ll over throw you.","607":" I\u2019m going to ask a question. When the president seeks a second term, it is generally a referendum on his record but vice president Biden, you\u2019d like to quote one of your dad\u2019s sayings, which is don\u2019t compare me to the almighty, compare me to the alternative. And in this case sir you are the alternative. Looking at both of your records, I\u2019m going to ask each of you. Why should voters elect you president over your opponent in this segment, President Trump you\u2019ll go first, two minutes.","608":" Because there is never been an administration or president who has done more than I\u2019ve done in a period of three and a half years. And that\u2019s despite the impeachment hoax and you so what happened today with Hillary Clinton, where it was a whole big con job. But despite going through all of these things where I had a fight, both flanks and behind me and above there has never been an administration that\u2019s done what I\u2019ve done. The greatest, before COVID came in the greatest economy in history, lowest unemployment numbers, everything was good. Everything was going.","609":" And by the way, there was unity going to happen. People were calling me for the first time in years, they were calling and they were saying it\u2019s time maybe and then what happened? We got hit. But now we\u2019re building it back up again. A rebuilding of the military, including Space Force and all of the other things. A fixing of the VA which was a mess under him, 308,000 people died because they didn\u2019t have proper health care. It was a mess. And we now got a 91% approval rating at the VA, our vets. We take care of our vets. But we\u2019ve rebuilt our military. And I\u2019ll tell you something, some people say maybe the most important by the end of the first term I\u2019ll have approximately 300 Federal judges and Court of Appeals judges, 300 and hopefully three great Supreme Court judges, justices that is a record the likes of which very few people and one of the reasons I\u2019ll have so many judges because President Obama and him left me 128 judges to fill.","610":" When you leave office, you don\u2019t leave any judges. That\u2019s like, you just don\u2019t do that. They left 128 openings and if I were a member of his party, because they have a little different philosophy, I\u2019d say, if you left us 128 openings you can\u2019t be a good president. You can\u2019t be a good vice president but I want to thank you because it gives us almost, it\u2019ll probably be above that number. By the end of this term, 300 judges. It\u2019s a record.","611":" Looking at both of your records. Why should voters elect you President as opposed to president Trump, you have two minutes uninterrupted.","612":"Under this president, we become weaker, sicker, poor, more divided and more violent. When I was vice president, we inherited a recession. I was asked to fix it. I did. We left him a booming economy and he caused the recession. With regard to being weaker, the fact is that I\u2019ve gone head to head with Putin and made it clear to him we\u2019re not going to take any of his stuff. He\u2019s Putin\u2019s puppy. He still refuses to even say anything to Putin about the bounty on the heads of American soldiers.","613":" You son got three and a half million dollars.","614":"By the way, my son\u2026","615":" Wait a minute. Mr. President, your campaign agreed to both sides would get two minute answers, uninterrupted. Well, you\u2019re a side agreed to it and why don\u2019t you observe what your campaign agreed to as a ground rule. Okay, sir?","616":"He never keeps his word.","617":" No, that was a rhetorical question.","618":"Can you get back 30 seconds?","619":" Yes. You may have, go ahead.","620":"So thirdly, we\u2019re poor. The billionaires have gotten much more wealthy by a tune of over $3- $400 billion more just since COVID. You in the home, you got less you\u2019re in more trouble than you were before. In terms of being more violent. When we were in office there were 15% less violence in America than there is today. He\u2019s President United States. It\u2019s on his watch. And with regard to more divided the nation, it can\u2019t stay divided. We can\u2019t be this way. And speaking of my son, the way you talk about the military, the way you talk about them being losers and being and just being suckers. My son was in Iraq. He spent a year there. He got the Brown Star. He got the Conspicuous Service Medal. He was not a loser. He was a Patriot and the people left behind there were heroes.","621":" Really?","622":"And I resent-","623":" Are you talking Hunter, are you talking about Hunter.","624":"I\u2019m talking about my son, Beau Biden, you\u2019re talking about Hunter?","625":" I don\u2019t know Beau. I know Hunter. Hunter got thrown out of the military. He was thrown out dishonorably discharged.","626":"That\u2019s not true he was not dishonorably discharged.","627":" For cocaine use. And he didn\u2019t have a job until you became vice president.","628":"None of that is true.","629":" Once you became vice president he made a fortune in Ukraine, in China, in Moscow and various other places.","630":"That is not true.","631":" He made a fortune and he didn\u2019t have a job.","632":"My son like a lot of people at home had a drug problem. He\u2019s overtaking it. He\u2019s fixed it. He\u2019s worked on it. And I\u2019m proud of him, I\u2019m proud of my son.","633":" But why was he given tens of millions of dollars?","634":"He wasn\u2019t given tens of millions of dollars. [crosstalk 004823] It was all discredited.","635":" We\u2019ve already been through this. I think the American people would rather hear about more substantial subjects. Well, as the moderator, sir, I\u2019m going to make a judgment call here.","636":" I know but when somebody gets three and a half million dollars from the Mayor of Moscow.","637":"That is not true. That report is totally discredited.","638":" Why did he get it?","639":"Mitt Romney on that committee said it wasn\u2019t worth taxpayer\u2019s money. That report was written for political reason.","640":" I\u2019d like to talk about climate change.","641":"So would I.","642":" Okay. The forest fires in the West are raging now. They have burned millions of acres. They have displaced hundreds of thousands of people. When state officials there blamed the fires on climate change. Mr. President, you said, I don\u2019t think the science knows. Over your four years, you have pulled the US out of the Paris Climate Accord. You have rolled back a number of Obama Environmental records, what do you believe about the science of climate change and what will you do in the next four years to confront it?","643":" I want crystal clean water and air. I want beautiful clean air. We have now the lowest carbon\u2026 If you look at our numbers right now, we are doing phenomenally. But I haven\u2019t destroyed our businesses. Our businesses aren\u2019t put out of commission. If you look at the Paris Accord, it was a disaster from our standpoint. And people are actually very happy about what\u2019s going on because our businesses are doing well. As far as the fires are concerned, you need forest management. In addition to everything else, the forest floors are loaded up with trees, dead trees that are years old and they\u2019re like tinder and leaves and everything else. You drop a cigarette in there the whole forest burns down. You\u2019ve got to have forest management.","644":" What do you believe about the science of climate change, sir?","645":" I believe that we have to do everything we can to have immaculate air immaculate water and do whatever else we can that\u2019s good. We\u2019re planting a billion trees, the Billion Tree Project and it\u2019s very exciting for a lot of people.","646":" You believe that human pollution, gas, greenhouse gas emissions contributes to the global warming of this planet.","647":" I think a lot of things do, but I think to an extent, yes. I think to an extent, yes, but I also think we have to do better management of our forest. Every year I get the call. California\u2019s burning, California\u2019s burning. If that was cleaned, if that were, if you had forest management, good forest management, you wouldn\u2019t be getting those calls. In Europe, they live they\u2019re forest cities. They call forest cities. They maintain their forest. They manage their forest. I was with the head of a major country, it\u2019s a forest city. He said, \u201cSir, we have trees that are far more, they ignite much easier than California. There shouldn\u2019t be that problem.\u201d I spoke with the Governor about it. I\u2019m getting along very well with the governor. But I said, \u201cAt some point you can\u2019t every year have hundreds of thousands of acres of land just burned to the ground.\u201d That\u2019s burning down because of a lack of management.","648":" But sir if you believe in the science of climate change, why have you rolled back the Obama Clean Power Plan which limited carbon emissions and power plants? Why have you relaxed\u2026?","649":" Because it was driving energy prices through the sky.","650":"Why have you relaxed fuel economy standards that are going to create more pollution from cars and trucks?","651":" Well, not really because what\u2019s happening is the car is much less expensive and it\u2019s a much safer car and you talk it about a tiny difference. And then what would happen because of the cost of the car you would have at least double and triple the number of cars purchased. We have the old slugs out there that are 10, 12 years old. If you did that, the car would be safer. It would be much cheaper by $3,500.","652":" But in the case of California they have simply ignored that.","653":" No, but you would take a lot of cars off the market because people would be able to afford a car. Now, by the way, we\u2019re going to see how that turns out. But a lot of people agree with me, many people. The car has gotten so expensive because they have computers all over the place for an extra little bit of gasoline. And I\u2019m okay with electric cars too. I think I\u2019m all for electric cars. I\u2019ve given big incentives for electric cars but what they\u2019ve done in California is just crazy.","654":" All right, Vice president Biden. I\u2019d like you to respond to the president\u2019s climate change record but I also want to ask you about a concern. You propose $2 trillion in green jobs. You talk about new limits, not abolishing, but new limits on fracking. Ending the use of fossil fuels to generate electricity by 2035 and zero none admission of greenhouse gases by 2050. The president says a lot of these things would tank the economy and cost millions of jobs.","655":"He\u2019s absolutely wrong, number one. Number two, if in fact, during our administration in the recovery act, I was in charge able to bring down the cost of renewable energy to cheaper than are as cheap as coal and gas and oil. Nobody\u2019s going to build another coal fired plant in America. No one\u2019s going to build another oil fire plant in America. They\u2019re going to move to renewable energy. Number one, number two, we\u2019re going to make sure that we are able to take the federal fleet and turn it into a fleet that\u2019s run on their electric vehicles. Making sure that we can do that, we\u2019re going to put 500,000 charging stations in all of the highways that we\u2019re going to be building in the future. We\u2019re going to build a economy that in fact is going to provide for the ability of us to take 4 million buildings and make sure that they in fact are weatherized in a way that in fact will they\u2019ll emit significantly less gas and oil because the heat will not be going out. There\u2019s so many things that we can do\u2026","656":"Gas and oil because the heat will not be going out. There\u2019s so many things that we can do now to create thousands and thousands of jobs. We can get to net zero, in terms of energy production, by 2035. Not only not costing people jobs, creating jobs, creating millions of good-paying jobs. Not 15 bucks an hour, but prevailing wage, by having a new infrastructure that in fact, is green. And the first thing I will do, I will rejoin the Paris Accord. I will join the Paris Accord because with us out of it, look what\u2019s happening. It\u2019s all falling apart. And talk about someone who has no relationship with foreign policy. The rainforests of Brazil are being torn down, are being ripped down. More carbon is absorbed in that rainforest than every bit of carbon that\u2019s emitted in the United States. Instead of doing something about that, I would be gathering up and making sure we had the countries of the world coming up with $20 billion, and say, \u201cHere\u2019s $20 billion. Stop tearing down the forest. And If you don\u2019t, then you\u2019re going to have significant economic consequences.\u201d","657":" What about the argument that President Trump basically says, that you have to balance environmental interests and economic interests? And he\u2019s drawn his line.","658":"Well, he hasn\u2019t drawn a line. He wants to make sure that methane\u2019s not a problem. You can now emit more methane without it being a problem. Methane. This is a guy who says that you don\u2019t have to have mileage standards for automobiles that exist now. This is the guy who says that, the fact that-","659":" Not true. Not true-","660":"It\u2019s all true. And here\u2019s the deal-","661":" He\u2019s talking about the Green New Deal. And it\u2019s not 2 billion [crosstalk 005545] or 20 billion, as you said [crosstalk 005546]. It\u2019s $100 trillion.","662":"I\u2019m talking about the Biden plan [crosstalk 005551]-","663":" Let him go for a minute, and then you can go.","664":" And rebuild the building.","665":"No.","666":" It\u2019s the dumbest-","667":"That is not-","668":" \u2026 most ridiculous [crosstalk 005556] where two car systems are out-","669":"Not true-","670":" \u2026 where they want to take out the cows too.","671":"Not true.","672":" That\u2019s not true either, right?","673":"Not true.","674":" This is a 100 trillion-","675":"Simply\u2026 Look-","676":" That\u2019s more money than our country could make in 100 years [crosstalk 000210]-","677":"That is simply not the case-","678":" All right. Let me [crosstalk 000212]. Wait a minute, sir. I actually have studied your plan, and it includes upgrading 4 million buildings, weatherizing 2 million homes over four years, building one and a half million energy efficient homes. So the question becomes, the president is saying, I think some people who support the president would say, that sounds like it\u2019s going to cost a lot of money and hurt the economy.","679":"What it\u2019s going to do, it\u2019s going to create thousands and millions of jobs. Good paying jobs [crosstalk 000241].","680":" Let him finish, sir.","681":"He doesn\u2019t know how to do that-","682":" 100 million dollars.","683":"The fact is, it\u2019s going to create millions of good paying jobs, and these tax incentives for people to weatherize, which he wants to get rid of. It\u2019s going to make the economy much safer. Look how much we\u2019re paying now to deal with the hurricanes, deal with\u2026 By the way, he has an answer for hurricanes. He said, maybe we should drop a nuclear weapon on them, and they may-","684":" I never said that at all-","685":"Yeah, he did say that-","686":" They made it up.","687":"And here\u2019s the deal-","688":" You make up a lot-","689":"\u2026 we\u2019re going to be in a position where we can create hard, hard, good jobs by making sure the environment is clean, and we all are in better shape. We spend billions of dollars now, billions of dollars, on floods, hurricanes, rising seas. We\u2019re in real trouble. Look what\u2019s happened just in the Midwest with these storms that come through and wipe out entire sections and counties in Iowa. They didn\u2019t happen before. They\u2019re because of global warming. We make up 15% of the world\u2019s problem. But the rest of the world, we\u2019ve got to get them to come along. That\u2019s why we have to get back into the Paris Accord.","690":" All right, gentlemen-","691":" Wait a minute, Chris. So why didn\u2019t he do it for 47 years? You were vice president-","692":"For 47-","693":" So why didn\u2019t you get the world\u2026 China sends up real dirt into the air. Russia does. India does. They all do. We\u2019re supposed to be good. And by the way, he made a couple of statements. The Green New Deal is a hundred trillion dollars.","694":"That is not my plan [crosstalk 005810]. The Green New Deal [crosstalk 005814] is not my plan. [crosstalk 005815]-","695":" Gentlemen-","696":" He made a statement about the military. He said I said something about the military. He and his friends made it up, and then they went with it. I never said it.","697":" Okay. [crosstalk 005824] Mr. Vice President-","698":" He called the military stupid bastards.","699":"I did not say that-","700":" He said it on tape. [crosstalk 005832]-","701":" Please, sir. [crosstalk 005833] Stop.","702":" I would never say that [crosstalk 005835]-","703":"Play it. Play it-","704":" Stop. Go ahead-","705":" You\u2019re on tape-","706":" Mr. Vice President answered his final question.","707":"The final question is, I can\u2019t remember which of all his rantings [crosstalk 000444].","708":" I\u2019m having a little trouble myself, but\u2026","709":"Yeah.","710":" And about the economy and about this question of what it\u2019s going to cost.","711":"The economy-","712":" The Green New Deal and the idea of what your environmental changes will do-","713":"The Green New Deal will pay for itself as we move forward. We\u2019re not going to build plants that, in fact, are great polluting plants-","714":" So, do you support the Green New Deal?","715":"Pardon me?","716":" Do you support the-","717":"No, I don\u2019t support the Green New Deal.","718":" Oh, you don\u2019t? Oh, well, that\u2019s a big statement.","719":"I support [crosstalk 000513]-","720":" You just lost the radical left.","721":"I support [crosstalk 005917] the Biden plan that I put forward.","722":" Okay.","723":"The Biden plan, which is different than what he calls the radical Green New Deal.","724":" All right, gentlemen, final segment, election integrity. As we meet tonight, millions of Americans are receiving mail-in ballots or going to vote early. How confident should we be that this will be a fair election, and what are you prepared to do over the next five plus weeks? Because it will not only be to election day, but also counting some mail-in ballots after election day. What are you prepared to do to reassure the American people that the next president will be the legitimate winner of this election. In this final segment, Mr. Vice President, you go first.","725":"Prepare to let people vote. They should go to iwillvote.com, decide how they\u2019re going to vote, when they\u2019re going to vote, and what means by which they\u2019re going to vote. His own Homeland Security director, and as well as the FBI director, says that there is no evidence at all that mail-in ballots are a source of being manipulated and cheating. They said that. The fact is that there are going to be millions of people because of COVID that are going to be voting by mail-in ballots like he does, by the way. He sits behind the Resolute Desk and sends his ballot to Florida, number one. Number two, we\u2019re going to make sure that those people who want to vote in person are able to vote because there are enough poll watchers are there to make sure they can socially distance. The polls are open on time, and the polls stay open until the votes are counted. And this is all about trying to dissuade people from voting because he\u2019s trying to scare people into thinking that it\u2019s not going to be legitimate.","726":"Show up and vote. You will determine the outcome of this election. Vote, vote, vote. If you\u2019re able to vote early in your state, vote early. If you\u2019re able to vote in person, vote in person. Vote whatever way is the best way for you, because you will\u2026 He cannot stop you from being able to determine the outcome of this election. And in terms of whether or not\u2026 When the votes are counted and they\u2019re all counted, that will be accepted. If I win, that will be accepted. If I lose, that\u2019ll be accepted. But by the way, if in fact he says, he\u2019s not sure what he\u2019s going to accept. Well, let me tell you something, it doesn\u2019t matter, because if we get the votes, it\u2019s going to be all over. He\u2019s going to go. He can\u2019t stay in power. It won\u2019t happen. It won\u2019t happen, so vote. Just make sure you understand, you have it in your control to determine what this country is going to look like the next four years. Is it going to change, or are you going to get four more years of these lies?","727":" Mr. President, two minutes.","728":" So when I listen to Joe talking about a transition, there has been no transition from when I won. I won that election. And if you look at crooked Hillary Clinton, if you look at all of the different people, there was no transition, because they came after me trying to do a coup. They came after me spying on my campaign. They started from the day I won, and even before I won. From the day I came down the escalator with our first lady, they were a disaster. They were a disgrace to our country, and we\u2019ve caught them. We\u2019ve caught them all. We\u2019ve got it all on tape. We\u2019ve caught them all. And by the way, you gave the idea for the Logan Act against General Flynn. You better take a look at that, because we caught you in a sense, and President Obama was sitting in the office.","729":" He knew about it too. So don\u2019t tell me about a free transition. As far as the ballots are concerned, it\u2019s a disaster. A solicited ballot, okay, solicited, is okay. You\u2019re soliciting. You\u2019re asking. They send it back. You send it back. I did that. If you have an unsolicited\u2026 They\u2019re sending millions of ballots all over the country. There\u2019s fraud. They found them in creeks. They found some, just happened to have the name Trump just the other day in a wastepaper basket. They\u2019re being sent all over the place. They sent two in a Democrat area. They sent out a thousand ballots. Everybody got two ballots. This is going to be a fraud like you\u2019ve never seen. The other thing, it\u2019s nice. On November 3rd, you\u2019re watching, and you see who won the election. And I think we\u2019re going to do well because people are really happy with the job we\u2019ve done.","730":" But you know what? We won\u2019t know. We might not know for months because these ballots are going to be all over. Take a look at what happened in Manhattan. Take a look at what happened in New Jersey. Take a look at what happened in Virginia and other places. They\u2019re not losing 2%, 1%, which by the way is too much. An election could be won or lost with that. They\u2019re losing 30 and 40%. It\u2019s a fraud, and it\u2019s a shame. And can you imagine where they say, \u201cYou have to have your ballot in by November 10th.\u201d November 10th. That\u2019s seven days after the election, in theory, should have been announced. We have major states [crosstalk 010358] with that-","731":" Sir.","732":" \u2026 all run by Democrats-","733":" Two minutes is two minutes.","734":" All run by Democrats.","735":" President Trump-","736":" It\u2019s a rigged election.","737":" You\u2019re going to be able to continue. You have been charging for months that mail-in balloting is going to be a disaster. You say it\u2019s rigged [crosstalk 00010411], that it\u2019s going to lead to fraud. But in 2018, in the last midterm election, 31 million people voted mail-in voting. That was more than a quarter of all the voters that year, cast their ballots by mail. Now that millions of mail-in ballots have gone out, what are you going to do about it? And are you counting on the Supreme Court, including a Justice Barrett, to settle any dispute?","738":" Yeah. I think I\u2019m counting on them to look at the ballots, definitely. I hope we don\u2019t need them, in terms of the election itself. But for the ballots, I think so, because what\u2019s happening is incredible. I read today where at least 1% of the ballots for 2016 were invalidated. They take them. We don\u2019t like them. We don\u2019t like them. They throw them out-","739":" But what are you going to do about it-","740":" \u2026 left and right.","741":" There are millions of ballots going out right now. What are you going to do-","742":" What you do is you go and vote. You do a solicited ballot, and that\u2019s okay-","743":" No. No. I know your complaint [crosstalk 010505]. I\u2019m asking you about the fact that millions of people have received-","744":" You go and vote. You go and vote-","745":" No. But what I\u2019m saying is [crosstalk 010511], what are you going to do about the fact that millions of people-","746":" You either do, Chris, a solicited ballot, where you\u2019re sending it in, they\u2019re sending it back and you\u2019re sending. They have mailmen with lots of it. Did you see what\u2019s going on? Take a look at West Virginia, mailman selling the ballots. They\u2019re being sold. They\u2019re being dumped in rivers. This is a horrible thing for our country.","747":"There is no [crosstalk 010532]\u2026 There is no evidence of that-","748":" This is not going to end well.","749":"There is no evidence of that-","750":" This is not going to end well-","751":" Okay. Vice President Biden, in fact, go ahead, sir-","752":"Five states have had mail-in ballots for the last decade or more. Five, including two Republican states. And you don\u2019t have to solicit the ballot. It\u2019s sent to you. It\u2019s sent to your home. What they\u2019re saying is that it has to be a postmark by election day. If it doesn\u2019t get in until the seventh, eighth, ninth, it still should be counted. He\u2019s just afraid of counting the votes-","753":" You\u2019re wrong. You\u2019re wrong [crosstalk 010604]. I love counting the votes [crosstalk 010605]-","754":" I want to continue with you on this [crosstalk 010606] Vice President Biden-","755":" Chris, he\u2019s so wrong when he makes a statement like that-","756":" No. Excuse me. Vice President Biden, the biggest problem, in fact, over the years with mail-in voting has not been fraud, historically. It has been that sizable numbers, sometimes hundreds of thousands of ballots are thrown out because they have not been properly filled out, or there is some other irregularity, or they missed [crosstalk 010628] the deadline. So the question I have is, are you concerned that the Supreme Court with a Justice Barrett will settle any dispute?","757":"I am concerned that any court would settle this, because here\u2019s the deal. When you get a ballot and you fill it out, you\u2019re supposed to have an affidavit. If you didn\u2019t know, you have someone say that, this is me. You should be able to, if in fact you can verify that\u2019s you before the ballot is thrown out, that\u2019s sufficient to be able to count the ballot because someone made a mistake and not dotting the correct I. Who they voted for, testify, say who they voted for, say it\u2019s you. That is totally legitimate.","758":" All right.","759":" Excuse me [crosstalk 010711]-","760":" No. No. No. I have a final [crosstalk 001312]. Gentlemen, I have a final question [crosstalk 010714]-","761":" You know it can\u2019t be done. You know it can\u2019t, and already, there\u2019s been fraud [crosstalk 010719]-","762":"Mail service delivers [crosstalk 010721] 185 million pieces of mail a day [crosstalk 010724]-","763":" We can keep talking. In eight states, [crosstalk 010727] election workers are prohibited, currently by law, eight states, from even beginning to process ballots, even take them out of the envelopes and flatten them until election day. That means that it\u2019s likely, because there\u2019s going to be a huge increase in mail-in balloting, that we are not going to know on election night who the winner is, that it could be days. It could be weeks-","764":" Could be months-","765":" \u2026 until we find out who the new president is. First for you, sir. Finally, for the vice president, and I hope neither of you will interrupt the other. Will you urge your supporters to stay calm during this extended period, not to engage in any civil unrest? And will you pledge tonight that you will not declare victory until the election has been independently certified? President Trump, you go first-","766":" I\u2019m urging my supporters to go in to the polls and watch very carefully, because that\u2019s what has to happen. I am urging them to do it. As you know, today there was a big problem. In Philadelphia, they went in to watch. They\u2019re called poll watchers, a very safe, very nice thing. They were thrown out. They weren\u2019t allowed to watch. You know why? Because bad things happen in Philadelphia. Bad things. And I am urging my people. I hope it\u2019s going to be a fair election. If it\u2019s a fair election-","767":" You\u2019re urging them what?","768":" \u2026 I am 100% on board. But if I see tens of thousands of ballots being manipulated, I can\u2019t go along with that. And I\u2019ll tell you why-","769":" What does that mean, not go along-","770":" \u2026 from a common sense-","771":" Does that mean you\u2019re going to tell your people-","772":" I\u2019ll tell you what it means-","773":" \u2026 to take to the streets?","774":" It means you have a fraudulent election. You\u2019re sending out 80 million ballots-","775":" And what would you do about that?","776":" They\u2019re not equipped\u2026 These people aren\u2019t equipped to handle it, number one. Number two, they cheat. They cheat. Hey, they found ballots in a wastepaper basket three days ago, and they all had the name military ballots. There were military. They all had the name Trump on them.","777":" Vice President Biden-","778":" You think that\u2019s good?","779":" Vice President Biden, final question for you. Will you urge your supporters to stay calm while the vote is counted? And will you pledge not to declare victory until the election is independently certified?","780":"Yes. And here\u2019s the deal. We count the ballots, as you pointed out. Some of these ballots in some states can\u2019t even be opened until election day. And if there\u2019s thousands of ballots, it\u2019s going to take time to do it. And by the way, our military\u2026 They\u2019ve been voting by ballots since the end of the Civil War, in effect. And that\u2019s what\u2019s going to happen. Why is it, for them, somehow not fraudulent. It\u2019s the same process. It\u2019s honest. No one has established at all that there is fraud related to mail-in ballots, that somehow it\u2019s a fraudulent process.","781":" It\u2019s already been established. Take a look at Carolyn Maloney\u2019s race-","782":" I asked you. You had an opportunity to respond [crosstalk 011013]. Go ahead [crosstalk 011014]. Vice President Biden, go ahead.","783":"He has no idea what he\u2019s talking about. Here\u2019s the deal. The fact is, I will accept it, and he will too. You know why? Because once the winner is declared after all the ballots are counted, all the votes are counted, that\u2019ll be the end of it. That\u2019ll be the end of it. And if it\u2019s me, in fact, fine. If it\u2019s not me, I\u2019ll support the outcome. And I\u2019ll be a president, not just for the Democrats. I\u2019ll be a president for Democrats and Republicans. And this guy-","784":" I want to see an honest ballot cut-","785":" Gentlemen, just say that\u2019s the end of it [crosstalk 011045]. This is the end of this debate-","786":" I want to see an honest ballot count.","787":" We\u2019re going to leave it there-","788":" And I think he does too-","789":" \u2026 to be continued in more debates as we go on. President Trump, Vice President Biden, it\u2019s been an interesting hour and a half. I want to thank you both for participating in the first of three debates that you have agreed to engage in. We want to thank Case Western Reserve University and the Cleveland Clinic for hosting this event. The next debate, sponsored by the Commission on Presidential Debates, will be one week from tomorrow, October 7th, at the University of Utah in Salt Lake City. The two vice presidential nominees, Vice President Mike Pence and Senator Kamala Harris will debate at 900 PM Eastern that night. We hope you watch. Until then, thank you, and good night. Thank you."}}
